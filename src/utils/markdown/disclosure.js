This website is here to give you a general idea about BlockLionsCapital, what we do, and who's on our team.

We're not trying to sell anything to investors through this site. The info here isn't an invitation for you to buy or sell investments with us. If we ever do offer investments, we'll make sure to give you all the details separately.

The stuff you see here isn't meant to be taken as financial advice. It's not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any investments. Also, what someone says on this site might not always be our official stance. Things could change.

When we talk about investments or projects, it's just a part of what we do. There's no guarantee those investments will make money, or that future ones will be similar.
